- Hi, I’m @alexisannsmith
- I’m interested in learning more about different programming languages. 
  Front-end programming is interesting to me, and has been one of the most challenging parts of programming I have learned so far!
- I’m currently learning more about Computer Science as a whole as I am a CS major at Colorado State University.
- I'm a lover of videogames, art, and cheesy television.
